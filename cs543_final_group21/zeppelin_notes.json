and I woke up and looked out He was standing right over there when it cracked \nI don't know \nHe's dreaming of him again walking around \nI guess he is \nI don't know the meaning of it But I know one thing Mom you've made a terrible mistake with father \nYou know Larry is not coming back and I know it Why do we allow him to go on thinking that we believe with him \nWhat do you want to do Argue with him \nI don't want to argue but it's time he realized that nobody believes Larry is alive \nYou know Why shouldn't he walk the nights thinking of him dreaming of him Do we contradict him Do we say we don't have any hope anymore That we haven't had any hope for years now \nYou can't say that to him \nWe've got to say it to him \nWhere's the proof Do you have any proof \nFor God's sake three years Nobody comes back after three years that's insane \nTo you it is to me it is but to your father you can talk yourself until you are blue in the face But there is no grave and there is no body so where are you \nSit down Mom I want to talk to you \nAll right all right all right You know why I asked Annie here right \nWhy \nYou know \nWell I got an idea but what's your story \nI'm going to ask her to marry me \nYou know it's not just my business \nSo all right then I'll just go ahead with it \nThen it's not just my business \nYou know sometimes you infuriate me you know that Isn't it your business if I tell father and he throws a fit about it God you have such a talent for ignoring things \nShe's not Larry's girl \nFrom your father's point of view he is not dead and Chris he still thinks he's still alive The girl is Larry's girl \nNow you can go on from there if you know where to go but I'm telling you I don't know where to go \nI don't know why it is but every time I reach out for something I have to pull back because I am afraid other people will suffer My whole bloody life time after time \nYou're a considerate fellow there's nothing wrong in that \nTo hell with that \nI just don't see why Have you asked Annie yet \nI wanted to get this settled first \nWell how do you know she's going to marry you Maybe she feels the same way your father does \nWell if she does then that's it That's the end of it From her letters though I think she's pretty much forgotten him \nAnd then we'll thrash it out with father Okay Mom Don't avoid me \nThe trouble is you don't see enough women You never did \nSo what I'm not fast with women \nWhy does it have to be Annie \nBecause it is \nOh that's a great reason It's no reason at all \nI don't know \nYou haven't seen her since you went away to war it's been five years \nI can't help it I know her best I was brought up next door to her you know These years when I think of someone for my wife I think of Annie \nMom what do you want A diagram \nI don't want a diagram \nHe thinks he's coming back Chris \nYou marry that girl you are pronouncing him dead \n and then what's that going to do to your father Do you know I don't \nAll right then Mom BREATHING \nJust give it some more thought \nI've given it three years of thought And I'd hope that if I waited father would forget about Larry and then we could just have a regular wedding and everyone would be happy \nBut if I can't do that here I may have to go somewhere else \nWhat the hell is this \nI'll get out I'll get married and I'll move somewhere else maybe New York \nI've been a good son for too long a good sucker \nYou have a business here What the hell is this \nThe business The business doesn't inspire me \nOh Must you be inspired \nYes I like it for an hour a day I don't care if I have to grub for money all day long when I come home I want it happy \nI want some kids I want a family I want somebody that I can give myself to and Annie is in the center of that Now it's just where to find it \nYou mean to tell me that you would leave the business over this \nOn this I would \nWell you don't want to think like that \nThen help me stay here \nAll right But you don't want to think like that because what the hell are we working for Chris It's all for you This whole shooting match is for you \nI know that Then just help me stay here \nJust don't think like that \nWell I am thinking like that \nI don't understand you do I \nNo You don't I'm a pretty tough guy \nI can see that \nWell maybe maybe he just wanted to see her \n BREATHING You don't look at me like that He didn't tell me anything more than he told you \nHe's not going to marry her \nHow do you know he's even thinking about it \nIt's got that about it \nWhat is going on here Joe \nNow listen \nShe is not his girl She knows she's not \nYou can't read her mind \nThen why is she still single New York is full of men why is she still single Probably a hundred people told her she's foolish but she waited \nHow do you know why she waited \nBecause she knows what I know that's why She's faithful as a rock In my darkest moments I think of her waiting and I know that I'm right \nHey look it's a nice day huh Why are we arguing \nNobody in this house dares take away her faith Joe You know strangers might but not his father not his brother \nWhat do you want me to do What do you want \nI want you to I want you to act like he is coming back both of you Don't think I haven't noticed you since Chris invited her here \nI won't stand for any nonsense \nKate \n BREATHING \nCalm yourself \nJust believe with me Joe Only last week a man came back in Detroit missing longer than Larry Believe with me You above all have got to believe Just believe \nOkay Calm yourself \nI know All right all right All right Okay Calm yourself What does that mean me above all \nI can't help it \nWhat have I got to hide What the hell is the matter with you Kate \nYou're the only one who still loves his parents \nI know It kind of went out of style didn't it \nIt's not so bad it's a good thing \n BREATHING You know it's lovely here The air is sweet \nYou're not sorry you came \nI'm not sorry no But I'm I can't stay \nFor one thing your mother much as told me to go \nWell \nAnd then you You've been kind of \nWhat \nSort of embarrassed ever since I got here \nWell I was kind of planning of sneaking up on you over the course of a week or so They just take it for granted that we're all set \nI knew they would \nWell sure from your mother's point of view Why else would I come \nI umm I guess I guess that's kind of why I came \n BREATHING \nI love you Annie I love you \n LAUGHTER \nI don't really have any imagination that's all I know how to say \n LAUGHTER \nAm I embarrassing you Are you See I didn't want to do it here with this yard on this porch I wanted it to be somewhere new some place fresh for both of us \nNo No\nChris I've been ready a long long time \nI almost got married two years ago \nYou started to write me \nEvery day since \nWhy didn't you let me know \nGive me a \nGive me a kiss \nbeating around the bush \nI will never forgive you All I'd done was sit around wondering if I was crazy waiting so long wondering if you were thinking about me \nOh Annie we are going to live now I am going to make you so happy \nNot like that you're not \nI kissed you \nLike Larry's brother Do it like you Chris \nHey let's drive some place Huh Let's get out of here \nNo it's nothing like that It's \nYeah I suppose I have been But it's going from me \nI don't even know how to start \nIt's just all mixed up with so many other things you know You know overseas I was in command of a company \nYeah sure \nWell I lost them \nHow many \nPretty much all \nAw geez \nYou can't just toss off a thing like that because they weren't just men You know \nThey didn't die they killed themselves for each other I mean that exactly Just a little more selfish and they would all be here today \nMmhmm \nTo bring that on to the earth again you know is like some kind of monument and I thought I would just make a difference to them \nBut then I came home and it was incredible you know The whole thing was just kind of this random bus accident You know I went back to the rat race again I went to work \nAnd I didn't want any of it I guess that included you \nI just want you to know Annie \nWhat would I do with a fortune \nFine \nOkay Is that is that \n BREATHING \nThe flashlight the silver one There's only one isn't there \nThat's not your flashlight \nWhose is it \nOh well Yeah of course \nYou keep saying my flashlight like it's just yours \nNo \nHow's that supposed to make me feel \nOf course our flashlight What's yours is mine Me flashlight es su flashlight \nNaturally God how could we not think to bring it I hope the moon stays out though \nDo they always run during a full moon I don't remember Was it full last year \nYeah \nHuh Are you cold

\nNo no Okay That's not my point My point is there is no point in coming down here if we just turn around and go home Don't you want to see it \nNot particularly \nWhy not \nPass what up I mean these fish swim out of the ocean they flop around on the beach they swim away and then they die \nYeah But this this moment on the beach is like the highlight of their little lives All that flopping around is laying eggs or what to do spawning or mating or whatever \nThis is a big night for these little guys It's like life's last orgy \nYeah they do \nOh Augie\nThere's like mystery here there's magic It's like a little bit of the unexplainable I just can't see how you're not interested \nYeah \nGod I don't get it you know the first time we came here you said it was the best night of your life \nAnd last year I remember distinctly you said you were so excited to get here that you don't remember you stubbed your toe until we were in the car \nAhh we weren't in a good spot \nHmm We didn't see them the year before either \nWe just weren't in a good spot I'm telling you this is a much better spot I have instincts for these things \nLook there see What's that No that's that's just seaweed \nGod this is great Think about this I know you are not interested but just think about this \nIt's single mindedness with no mind It is urgency that is just pure urge \nThat's the wind \nSo what do you think \nAbout what \nAbout all of that about all I was talking about \nLook at this all of the hairs are standing up on my arm \nThat's the wind \nWell so what do you think \nAbout what \nAbout what I was saying \nNot just me look at all of these people \nCarla can I ask you something Now don't take this the wrong way but are you on your period \nDon't ask me that I hate it when you ask me that you always ask me that It's insulting \nWell then what's bugging you \nWe just have different ideas of what this night is supposed to look like \nThere is nothing to it we come down here the fish arrive they flop around they do their fish thing We go ooh ah look at the fish and we go home \nFor God Grow up Augie The fish are not going to arrive \nWhy not \nBecause they never do Have they Have they ever \nWe've missed them twice \nTwice is every time we have tried that's ever \nThey'll show up this time \nI feel like my whole life is going to be spent standing on this beach with my eyes wide open and my hands clasped expectantly waiting for fish to show up And the fish never show up \nYou don't understand anything I am saying \nNo Of course not \nI feel like I'm always just standing here waiting I feel like this night is going to be the night but it never is \nIt's just fish it's nothing to get traumatized over \nFor God's sake this is not about fish \nOkay I'm trying to work this backwards and pinpoint the exact moment where we took a turn for the worst here \nOkay So I am putting out the pets getting the car out of the garage \nDo you remember the first year we came here It was like four years after we got married \nIt's when we were driving past that Knickerbocker Liquor Locker you said let's get some champagne I said no time's a wasting or something like that \ndancing barefoot in the sand \nThat's what it is Right You want this to be like the other time right \nI'd rather not remember some things I'd rather not hope for some things \nSure All right Okay \nListen do you want to dance \nNo \nDo you want me to go get some champagne \nDo you want to take off your shoes \nNo no Nothing \nDo you want to get married again \nNo \nNo \n BREATHING \nDo you know what you get You get this \nThis What is this This is nothing This isn't even anything \nYes it is \nI mean this is a lot of things but it's just \n BREATHING \nDo you understand what I am saying \nI'm doing the best I can \nI know you are Augie I know \nI know you meant this to be special I know that you wanted it to be right but I just can't help thinking that I can't help wishing that I was somewhere else \nMaybe if you were with someone else too \nI didn't say that \nI just I know I don't make you happy \nYou're the one who probably wishes he was with somebody else Somebody who doesn't take things so seriously who could enjoy herself \nYou know actually now that you mention it no I don't \nSo maybe we are in the wrong spot but we are with the right person \nI don't know it seemed like such a good spot to me \nWe have a great view of the moon from here though huh \nHmm I noticed that it's pretty Big old white moon \n BREATHING \nAnd look what I got here \nAugie you bought refreshments \nI guess we don't need glasses \n BREATHING \nDo you want to go home Are you cold \nI'm beginning to think this might be the right spot after all \nAugie I'm sorry \nShh If we're very quiet the fish might come \nOr not \nOr not \nI don't care then \nNo Wrong number LAUGHTER \n LAUGHTER That sent shivers up my spine \nWhat shall we do if they suddenly walk in on us LAUGHTER \nWe'll behave exquisitely \nWith perfect poise \nI think I shall do a curtsy \nIt's strange things that ought to matter dreadfully they just don't matter at all when one's happy Do they \nYes Meaning just that \nWell what does it all mean That's what I ask myself in my quest for ultimate truth Dear God what does it all mean \nDon't laugh at me I'm being serious \nWho's they \nWho knows \nYes Yes with all of his might \nLet's be superficial and just pity those poor philosophers huh Let's blow trumpets and squeakers and enjoy the party for as long as we can you know like small idiotic school children \n LAUGHTER \nOh Come and kiss me darling before your body rots and worms pop out of your eye sockets \nOh Elliott worms don't pop \nAw Thank you darling The same applies to you too except that if you so much as look at another woman I'll kill you \nOh Charles that was his name He did wiggle so beautifully \nThat was a rouser wasn't it \nThe manager came in he found us rolling about the floor biting and scratching like panthers LAUGHTER How utterly utterly ridiculous \n LAUGHTER I'll never forget his face LAUGHTER \n LAUGHTER We were very much younger then \n LAUGHTER And very much sillier \nAnd very much sillier \nHowever I believe the real cause of that row was Peter Burden \nOh You knew there was nothing in that \nI knew nothing of the sort You took presents from him \nPresents It was only a trivial little brooch \nYou went out of your way to torture me over Peter Burden \nI did not You worked that whole thing up in your jealous imagination \nWell you let him kiss you huh You said you did \nWell what of it \nWhat about me \nOh dear I'm bored with this conversation \nSo am I I'm bored stiff GARBAGE Do you want some brandy \nI'll have a little I think \nNo particular reason Anyhow they are very small ones \nYou can hardly call three glasses of liquor a whole evening long going on and on and on \nOh Don't be so grand Just because you don't happen to want one at the moment \nDon't be stupid \nReally Amanda \nWhat \nNothing \nyou going out somewhere dear \nNo I am just making myself fascinating for you \nOh It's a woman's duty to allure the man \nWell as a matter of fact yes that's perfectly true \nNo it isn't \nYes it is \nYou shut up \nOh really It's a pity you didn't have any brandy it would have made you a little less disagreeable \nSnap snap snap You know you are like a little adder \nNonsense They have a bag of venom behind their fangs and they snap They snap \nThey sting I don't care Do you understand I don't care if they bark and they roll about like hoops \nDid you see much of Peter Burden after our divorce \nYes I did quite a lot \nAnd I suppose you let him kiss you a good deal more than too Yes I suppose you guys had a riotous time huh All out no restraint at all Well you never really had much anyhow \nMind your own business \nYou're quite insufferable I expect it's because you are drunk \nI think I am not in the least bit drunk \nYou've always had a weak head \nI think I mentioned once before that I've had three minute liquor glasses the whole evening long A child of two cannot get drunk on that \nOn the contrary a child of two can get violently drunk on only one glass of brandy \nThat's very interesting Amanda How about a child of four Or a child of six Or a child of nine We can get a good little conversation going on about this you know intemperate tots \nOh shut up \nShut up \nNot very funny darling Why don't you have some more brandy \nLook you better turn that off I don't want to wake up the people upstairs \nWhy \nThere are no people upstairs it's a photographer's studio \nWell then you'll wake up the people downstairs \nThey are away in Tunis \nThis is no time of year for Tunis \nI will do no such thing \nFine if you insist on being boorish and idiotic \nWill you turn that off it's driving me mad \nYou are far too temperamental try to control yourself \nTurn it off \nI won't Let go let go of me Listen listen I'm sick and tired of listening to you you sadistic bully \nAmanda listen listen \nOh That's very amusing indeed \nOh shut up Let go I hate you I hate you Do you hear You are a conceited and overbearing and utterly impossible \nYou are a vile ill tempered loose living wicked little beast and I never want to see you again as long as I live \nThis is the end Do you hear me

got to believe Just don't stop believing \nWhat does that mean Me above all What does that mean \nLook at you You're shaking \nWhat the hell do you want from me Kate \nThe only one I know still love his parents \nYeah that kind of went out of style didn't it \nOh it's not bad thing it's good thing \nYou're not sorry you came \nNot sorry no I can't stay here \nWhy not \nFor one thing your mother as much as told me to go \n BREATHING And then you've been kind of \nWhat \nYou've been kind of embarrassed ever since I got here \nYou did \nFrom her point of view why else would I come \nYeah \nAnn I love you I love you \nI almost got married two years ago \nWhy didn't you \nEveryday since \nwhy didn't you let me know \nBecause I was waiting for you Chris Till then you never wrote me and then when you did well you sure can be ambiguous you know \nI kissed you I kissed Annie \nI'll never forgive you for waiting so long All I did was sit around and wonder if I was crazy for thinking about you \nI kissed you \nChris what's the matter \nDo you want to go somewhere Let's go \nNo what is it Is your mother \nNo no it's nothing like that \nI don't know it's it's complicated But it's going from me now \nYou got to tell me \nI don't know \nIt's kind of all mixed up with all these other things \nWouldn't work like this \nyou know over seas I was in command of the company \nYeah sure \nWell I lost them \nHow many \nPretty much all \n BREATHING Geez \nTakes awhile to toss something like that off I mean they weren't just men you know \nFor instance there was this one time when this kid it had been raining for like several days and he gave me his last pair of dry socks \nHe just put it in my pocket that's the kind of guys I had \nThey didn't die they killed themselves for each other and I mean that exactly you know a little more selfish and they'll all be here today \nYou know that they were bringing something on to this earth a kind of sacrifice you know \nI thought I would change everything you know and I got back here and it was it was like nothing had changed at all \nYou know I went to work with dad and I started that whole rat race again \nAnd no one had changed it was just like sort of random bus accident to them \nDriving my new car and I felt guilty you know opening my bank book seeing a new refrigerator \n'Cause you can take those things out of a war But you have to realize that those things came out of the love that a man can have for another man \nAnd if you can't see that then it's just loot and there's blood all over it \nI felt ashamed and I didn't want any part of it I guess I included you too \nDo you still feel that way \nI want you to know Annie \nI'm going to make a fortune for you \nWhat would I do with a fortune \nWhat time is it God this is great isn't it I can't believe it \nLook there what's that what's that Is it \nUgh \nOh no I can't tell though Although probably if you can't tell it probably isn't them right yeah Probably going to be like unmistakable right \nGosh this is great isn't it This is awesome Oh no you know what I forgot \nFlashlight the silver one There's only one isn't there \nOh well yeah of course \nYou keep saying my flashlight like somehow it's just yours How's that supposed to make me feel \nOf course our flashlight What's your is mine mi flashlight es su flashlight \nGosh I should have brought it I can't believe I forgot that \nNo \nYou know what we should've brought a blanket too Man our blanket our blanket Wish I had six pack too a six pack would be just the ticket right about now huh six pack \nI'm fine \nOh yeah I'm so excited right now I'm like a kid \nI can't believe I got out of the house without my fly zipped up even \nI wonder if they can hear me talk\nI'm cold \nDo you want my jacket \nIt's after eleven let's go home \nWhat are you kidding We just got here We don't want to turn around and go home now What's the point coming all the way down here \nThere is no point \nRight \nThat's my point \nThat's my point too \nThen let's go \nNo wait no no that's not my point My point is there is no point and coming all the way down here if we just turn around and go home \nWhy not \nIt's not stupid It's a natural phenomenon \nPeople in Kansas would have to get plane tickets and make hotel reservations to see this It's only forty minutes away it's just too good to pass up \nPass what up These little fish swim out of the ocean they flop around on the sand then they swim back and then they die \nI don't know what you're so excited about This isn't a moon landing we're talking about it's fish it's a fish nobody even eats \nYeah they do \nOh Augie \nIt's like a little bit of the unexplainable a little magic a little mystery I just don't see how you can not be interested in this \nI'm not \nYes \nAll right \nI don't get it though I mean the first time we came here you said it was like the best night of your life \nAnd last year I remember like distinctively you were so excited to get here that you didn't realize you stubbed your toe until we were in a car \nLast year you'll also remember we got our shoes got wet I got sand in my panties you got a sore throat we got into a big fight and we did not see the grunions \nWe just weren't in a good spot though \nWe didn't see them the year before either \nCome on trust me I got instincts for these things okay So just just think about it all right Okay I know you're not interested think about it \nOut there there's like this big mass of silver fish they're heading this way \nThey don't know why we don't know why No one like sent them an invitation or gave them a map or direction \nThey just all turned at once and they just form this line as long as the California coast And they just started swimming \nLike some little time release fire cracker went off inside their little tiny bodies And they all turned as one \nAnd form the line and started swimming swimming that would bring them to this point here \nIt's like urgency that's pure urge you know It's single mindedness with no mind \nIt's crazy Look at this I'm giving myself goose bumps the hairs are standing up on my arm \n to this spot for this massive celebration of like sex and death \nLook at this my hairs are standing up my arm I'm giving myself goose bumps \nThat's the wind \nWell so What do you think \nI think it's ridiculous \nIt's a PR \nIt's not just me okay Look at like all the people \nThey're all told the same thing \nEverybody is believes that it keeps them excited you know it keeps them coming back for more \nEverybody keeps thinking that they can just find the right spot you know they'll get it on the action \nTheir life will start then \nI'm sorry it still just fish to me \nCan I ask you a question Are you on your period \nWhy do you ask me that God damn it I told you not to ask me that I hate it when you ask me that It's insulting \nI just we just have different ideas of what this evening is supposed to look like \nIs not supposed to like anything We come down here we look at the fish they arrive we go woo ah fish \nOh Grow up Augie the fish are not going to come \nWhy not \nBecause they never do Do they have they ever \nWe missed them twice \nTwice is every year we've tried that's ever \nOkay we'll see them this year this is a much better spot Trust me \nNo we won't It's pointless it's like a waiting up to see Santa Claus \nI feel like my whole life is going to be spent here on the beach with my eyes wide open and my hands clasped expectantly waiting for fish to show up and the fish never show \nOkay I'm trying to work this backwards\nYou don't understand anything I'm saying \nand figure out where we took a turn to the worst thing \nOf course not \nOkay I'm trying to work this backwards here and I'm trying to figure out the exact moment that you took a turn for the worst here now \nyou were fine during the phone call from Marge dinner was okay doing the dishes was fine \nLet's see uh I took a shower and um you were watching the news and you said the the Grunions are running tonight and I said okay great let's go \nSo I'm putting the animals out we're getting the car to the garage and \nDo you remember the first year we came here It's about four years ago right after we got married \nAnd I remember thinking this is it finally finally I'm as happy as I'm supposed to be \nWait a minute I've got it \nI'd rather not remember some things I'd rather not hope for some things \nOh right sure of course \nNo \nYou want me to go get some champagne \nNo \nDo you want to take off our shoes \nWhat Huh \nYou want to get married again \nWhat What You want to divorce \nNo \nA vacation \nNo \nA new carpet a poodle a suicide pact ice cream a back rub what What What the hell do you want \nI want something to turn out the way that it's supposed to \nWell welcome to the human race \nYou think nothing turns out how it's supposed to You think I had some grand idea going that four years down the line We would come to this beach and argue over fish No \nNo no I'm just like you I thought it was going to be all rosy cheeks and the bills would pay themselves and fish will always come and \nNo You know what you get You know what you get You get this \nThis what What is this This isn't even anything \nYeah it is \nOh sure this is standing on the beach this is waiting fighting \nRight \nThis isn't anything like I thought anything would be \nI know me neither \nThis is just this I mean it includes a lot and everything but it's do you understand what I'm saying \nI'm doing the best I can \nI know that Augie I really do \nI just can't help wishing that I was somebody somewhere else \nMaybe if you were with somebody else too \nI didn't say that \nNo I know but I know I don't make you happy \nYeah \nYou are the one who probably wishes he was with somebody else someone who didn't take everything so seriously someone who would enjoy yourself \nLook what we got here \nIt's not champagne \nI guess we don't need glasses \nAre you cold huh Do you want to go home \nI'm beginning to think you might be right I think this might be the spot after all \nAugie I'm sorry \nShh \nIf we are really quiet the fish might come \nOr not \nOr not \nNow and always sweet \nI don't care then \nIt had to happen sooner or later \n BREATHING \nOh Behave exquisitely \nWith perfect poise \n LAUGHTER I think I shall do a court curtsey \nAh \n LAUGHTER \nAh Strange \nMmm \nThings that just ought to matter dreadfully you know they just don't matter at all when one is happy do they \nDarling don't say that \nOh yes meaning just that \nOh dear god what is that all mean dear god \n LAUGHTER Don't laugh at me I'm being serious \nYou mustn't be so serious darling it just what they want \nFlippancy brings out the acid in their darn sweetness and light \nMmhmm If I must laugh at everything I must laugh at us too \nHow long will it last this ludicrous overbearing love of ours \nWe are figures of fun all right\nAhh who knows \nShall we always want to bicker and fight \nIf one of us dies \nI think you're talking nonsense \nLet's pity the poor philosophers huh Let's enjoy the party for as long as we can okay Let's blow trumpets and squeakers and sit like small idiotic school children LAUGHTER \nCome here darling kiss me\nbefore your body rots and worms pop out of your eye sockets \nSee you know I don't care what you do You could paint yourself green and run naked to the Place Vendome \nDo you remember that row we did have in Venice \nWhich particular one \nOh Charles That was his name Charles He did wriggle so beautifully \nBut you know it wasn't as bad as the one we had in Cannes mmhmm where your curling irons burnt a hole in my dressing gown \nCannes mmhmm \nThe manager came in he found us rolling about the floor LAUGHTER \nI will never forget the look on his face \nScratching and biting like panthers LAUGHTER Oh \noh \nUtterly utterly ridiculous \noh LAUGHTER \nWe were very much younger then \nVery much sillier \nOh you knew there was nothing in that \nWell what of it \nNo thank you \nI'll have a little I think

\nYou know what You snap you snap you snap you're like a little adder \nNonsense They have a bag of venom behind of fangs and they snap \nThey sting \nI don't care I don't care do you understand I don't mind if they bark and they roll about like hoops \nDid you see much of Peter Burden after our divorce \nYes I did quite a lot \nI suppose you let him just kiss you or good deal more than too \nOh mind you own business \nI suppose you two had a riotous time huh No restrain at all very enjoyable he never had much any how \nYou're quite insufferable I expect it's because you're drunk \nI am not in the least bit drunk \nYou always had a weak head \nI think I told you once before that I had three minute liquor glasses the whole evening long A Child of two cannot get drunk on that \nOn the contrary a child two could get violently drunk on only one glass of brandy \nOh very very interesting Amanda How about the child of uh four six or maybe nine you know we could work up a splendid little debate about it you know Intemperate tots \nShut up \nNot very funny darling Why don't you have some more brandy \nThat's a very good idea I think I will \nWould you uh turn that off please You're going to wake the people upstairs \nWhy \nWell then you'll wake the people downstairs \nThey are away in Tunis \nThis is no time a year for Tunis \nTurn it on again please \nI will do no such

but maybe if just because it's competitive like maybe I'm just not good enough Maybe the level is here and I'm here and there's just no way I'm ever gonna do that \nThere There are plenty of people out there with with like good jobs you know that are a lot \n dumber than you I mean they're a lot worse off than you You are much better off than like a lot of those people in there I know\nI didn't have like one of those starts you know like a family member who was already in the business or something you know that could like give me a helping hand \nI know It makes it harder I mean it's definitely who you know in a lot of cases but \nBut you gotta Otherwise what is what's your other option \nI feel so worthless \nIt's not worthless 'cause it's definitely gonna it's definitely gonna pay off I know it I mean I can I've just I've seen your work etiquette You know you're a good worker and \n and there's no reason that that something won't come up like really soon All right So you just gotta \nAnd what would make you say that There doesn't seem to be any indicators that anything's going to get better \nOr they'll never talk to me again \nOr well no Okay you GARBAGE \nI guess the money shouldn't matter to me but Somehow it does You know It's not like I do it for the money but\nRight \nWell you've gotta live \nyou have to I mean if you're hired by somebody then you're not a professional you're an amateur and that means that you're not good enough \nI mean it's just it's really I don't know yeah it's about their opinions and it's about I don't know just getting yourself out there and \nI just wanna crawl in a hole you know Like it just makes you not wanna even open your eyes in the morning \nWell come on come on Thinking about it like this is definitely not gonna help either though \nHi um excuse me I believe that the airline lost my baggage \nUm okay it didn't didn't come out on the carrousel \nNo it didn't um It didn't come out and I don't see it anywhere around here so what can you do about that \nOkay Um well unfortunately yeah there was a some some problems with the \nUh well some some of the bags were were lost on the way over here uh \nYou know I mean there's a lot of things that go on under the plane and sometimes you know that kind of things happen \nUh But we are willing to reimburse you for the bag and and for the contents \nHow much \nUm we'd be willing to give you uh fifty dollars for \nRight Uh We realize you know that that it's a bad situation but I'm sorry there's nothing that we can really do \nThat's all that's all that's all you're going to do is just give me fifty dollars and say go have fun on your vacation without any of your stuff \nI think um maybe you can file a claim if you want and turn it in to our main office \nYes yes I would like to file a claim but what are you gonna I mean is it just gonna show up magically out of nowhere \nRight No I mean they they might they might if you if you are argue the case more maybe they'll reimburse you more but right now \nYes I know I know It's It's frustrating Unfortunately though um\nBecause you don't seem to care very much you know \nBy checking your bags you you you know admit to the liability that's that's at risk \nI didn't sign anything \nRight well by checking in your bags you agreed to you know at the will of the \nWell there are there are some shops here in in the airport \nBut fifty dollars isn't going to get me anything \nNo um like I said you can file a claim and uh maybe get reimbursed for more you\nIsn't there anything else you can do \nprobably even talk to \nRight that that gets taken care of That gets taken care of We get we do you know we investigate those and just make sure that um they're not doing their own thing with them so uh\nYeah I'm sure you You're like hmm do you take baggage No Oh okay thanks Great I mean how \nbut Unfortunately sometimes is \nWell that's that's what I'm saying \nThere needs to be better security here \nIt sounds like it's such a little like oh well no big deal whatever It's a big deal to me \nWell can I at least have my fifty dollars please \nYes all right There you go now you can file a claim over to the left And they'll help you out \nThank you very much \nHey a what's up \nUm Johnny died yesterday \nWow that's horrible \nI'm sorry to hear about that \nWe knew that it was coming but \nYeah \nIt seemed like he had a little bit longer Like just last week he was doing was so well \nI mean you know at least he's not in anymore pain now right \nYeah \nIt's good you know you know It hurts I know I know what it's like to lose someone like that \nI just don't want him to be gone \nIt's okay \n'Cause you know you've got all the times that you guys did spend together you know and that's something good that you can look back on \nI mean I don't know \nAnd his whole family was there \nI mean he was like really conscious right up until the end you know\nWell that's that's good you know At least I don't know I mean it's it's better to go to goout that way than \n than you know in pain and like this gradual this horrible process I mean \nHe was so young you know And all the stories he used to tell me about \n the way he wanted to live and he was gonna go to Africa and he was gonna \nBut look at the he look at the life he did get to lead I mean for his age he'd done so much and \nNobody's ever gonna forget him \nYeah exactly He's made a big impact on a lot of people and\nAnd you'll always have that and you should feel you know happy for him that he got to do so much before I mean and even after he found out last year I mean \nHe did a lot But \nI know It doesn't bring him back but \nBut It's okay because now you know you'll just go on with your life and

waiting for him Do we contradict him Do we say straight out that we don't have any hope anymore That we haven't had hope for years now \nYou can't say that to him \nWe've got to say it to him \nCan you prove it How can you prove it \nFor God sakes it's been three years Nobody comes back after three years It's insane \nTo you it is and to me but not to him I mean you can talk yourself blue in the face but he there's no body and no grave so where are you \nAll right All right Listen to me You know why I brought Annie here don't you \nI've got an idea but what's the story \nI'm gonna ask her to marry me \nWell that's only your business Chris \nYou know it's not only my business \nWhat do you want me to do You're old enough to know your own mind \nSo it's all right then \nI'll go ahead with it \nWell then it isn't just my business \nI'm just saying that \nShe's not Larry's girl \nFrom your father's point of view he isn't dead And you've no right to take his girl \nAnd you can go on from there if you know where to go but I don't know where to go See I don't know Now what can I do for you \nI don't know why but every time I reach out for something that I want I have to pull back 'cause someone else will suffer My whole bloody life Time after time after time \nYou're a considerate fellow There's nothing wrong with that \nTo hell with that \n BREATHING Have you asked Annie yet \nWell how do you know she'll marry you Maybe she feels the same way your father does \nWell if she does then that's the end of it But from her letters I think she's forgotten him I'll find out And then we'll thrash it out with Dad right Mom don't avoid me \nTrouble is you don't see enough women \nYou never did \nI just don't see why it has to be Annie \nBecause it is \nWell that's a good answer but it doesn't answer anything I mean you've been away for at war It's been five years \nThese years when I think of a wife I think of Annie What do you want a diagram \nI don't want a diagram Umm He thinks he's coming back Chris You marry that girl and you're pronouncing him dead \nI mean what's gonna happen to your father Do you know I don't \nAll right All right then Mom \nI just give it some more thought \nI've given it three years of thought I thought that if I waited Dad would forget about Larry and we could have a regular wedding and everything happy \nAre you crazy \nI've been a good son too long A good sucker I'm through with it \nWhat about the business What the hell is this \nThe business The business doesn't inspire me \nMust you be inspired \nYes I like it an hour a day If I'm gonna grub for my money all day long at least in the evening I want it beautiful \nYes on this I would \nWell you don't want to think like that \nI know I know Mom Just help me stay here \nAll right Just just don't go thinkin' that way you hear me \nI am thinkin' that way \nI don't understand you do I \nNo you don't I'm a pretty tough guy \nI can see that \nWell maybe he just wanted to see her again \nWhat do you mean He lived next door to the girl all his life Why wouldn't he want to see her again \nHow do you know he's even thinking of it \nIt's got that all about it \nWell so what \nNow listen Kate \nYou can't read her mind \nWell then why is she still single I mean New York is full of men Why isn't she married Probably a hundred people told her she's crazy but she's waited \nHow do you know why she's waited \nShe knows what I know that's why She's faithful as a rock In my worst moments I think of her waiting and I know again that I'm right \nLook it's a nice day What are we arguing for \nWell what do you want me to do about it \nI want you to act like he's coming back Both of you Don't you think I haven't noticed since she got here I won't stand for any nonsense \nBut Kate \nBecause if he's not coming back I'll kill myself I mean laugh laugh at me but \nBut why did that happen the very night she came here She sleeps in his room and his memorial breaks to pieces Just look Look at it \nCalm yourself \nBelieve with me Joe I can't stand all alone \nCalm yourself \nLast week a man turned up in Detroit missing longer than Larry I mean you read it yourself \nAll right All right Calm yourself \nYou above all have to believe \nJust just don't stop believing \nWhat does that mean Me above all \nLook at you Look at you shaking \nI can't help it \nWhat have I got to hide What the hell is the matter with you Kate \nYou're not sorry you came \nfrom her point of view why else would I come \nYou feel it's wrong here don't you This yard this chair I want you to be ready for me I don't want to have to win you away from anything \nI almost got married two years ago \nYou started to write me and \nEvery day since \nI will never forgive you Why did you wait all these years All I did was sit and wonder if I was crazy for thinking of you \nNo Nothing like that \nThen what's wrong I mean even in your letters there was some something ashamed \nYeah I suppose I have been But it's going from me \nYou've gotta tell me \nI don't know how to start \nIt wouldn't work this way \nIt's all mixed up with so many other things You remember overseas I was in command of a company \nYeah sure \nWell I lost them \nHow many \nJust about all \nOh gee \nIt takes some time for a guy to toss that off 'Cause they weren't just men \nThey didn't die they killed themselves for each other I mean that exactly A little more selfish and they'd have been here today \nI got this idea watching them go down Everything was being destroyed see but it seemed that there was one new thing being made A sort of responsibility Man for man \nYou know what I mean To show that to bring that onto the Earth again like some kind of monument and everyone would feel it standing behind him and it would make a difference to him \nThen I came back and it was incredible There was no meaning in it here The whole thing to them seemed like sort of a bus accident I went to work with Dad and that rat race again \nI mean you can take those things out of a war but when you drive that car you've gotta know that it came out of the love a man can have for a man You've gotta be a little better because of it \nBecause otherwise all you have is really loot and there's blood on it And I didn't want to take any of it And I guess that included you \nYou still feel that way \nWhat'll I do with a fortune \nWhat time is it They're supposed to run around midnight \nThis is great isn't it Look at the night we've got here couldn't be better \nI would have liked to have gone a little further up the coast to get away from the lights and the people but I was afraid we'd miss it \nHow you doing \nIs that no is that just foam I can't even tell \nWell I guess we can tell it probably isn't right Probably be unmistakable don't you think \nHow you doing Aw you know what I forgot I forgot to bring my flashlight Oh how could I be so stupid I should've brought my flashlight \nWhat flashlight \nOh well sure \nRight of course Our flashlight Mine and yours I mean me flashlight is su flashlight naturally \nI wonder do they always run during a full moon I can't remember if it was full last year Do you remember \nYeah \nYou cold Do you want my jacket Oh we should've brought the blanket Our blanket \nThis is great isn't it A six pack would be just the ticket right now \nI can't believe I forgot I'm like a kid It's amazing I got out of the house with my fly zipped \nYou think they can hear us talk Or feel the vibrations in the sand when we move around \nDo you want my jacket \nIt's after eleven let's just go home \nRight \nThat's my point too \nNo No That's not my point The point is there's no point in coming down if we just leave Don't you want to see it \nThink about the people in Kansas they had to get plane tickets and hotel reservations to see this We live forty minutes away It's too good to pass up \nPass up what These little fish swim onto the beach they flop around and swim away And then they die \nYeah but that moment on the beach is the highlight of their little lives All that flopping is laying eggs or what do you spawning or mating I mean \nthis is a big night for these guys Life's last orgy \nWhat are you so excited about I mean it's not a moon landing we're talking about here It's fish It's a fish nobody even eats \nYeah they do \nAh Augie \nAlright But it's fish that do something that none of the other fish do Like the swallows returning to Capistrano or the lemmings throwing themselves off the cliffs \nI'm just not \nI don't get it The first time we came here you said it was the best night of your life \nLast year you will also remember our shoes got wet I got sand in my panties you got a sore throat we got in a big fight over nothing and we didn't see the grunions \nWe weren't in a good spot \nWe didn't see them the first time either \nThere is that no that's just seaweed isn't it \nOh man this is great isn't it I wouldn't miss this for anything Here think about this all right I know you're not interested but think about this \nIt's like single mindedness with no mind It's urgency that's pure urge They don't know what drives them They don't ask it a question or give it a name \nThey just turn as one and start the swim that brings them right here to where we stand for a massive celebration of sex and death \nAh God I'm giving myself goose bumps Look all my hairs are popped up \nWell so what do you think \nAbout what \nWhat I was saying \nWell so what do you think \nAbout what \nWhat I was saying \nIt's ridiculous \nIt certainly is not It's slightly exaggerated scientific fact \nWell I'm not the only one Look at all these people \nCarla can I ask you something Don't take this wrong but are you having your period \nGod damn it Augie don't ask me that I hate it when you ask me that You always ask me that It's insulting \nWell what's bugging you \nWe just have different ideas of what this evening is supposed to look like \nThere's nothing to it We come here the grunion arrive they do their little fish business we go ooh ah look at the fish They go home We go home \nFor heaven sake we're not going to see the grunions \nWhy not \nWe never do do we I mean have we ever \nWe've missed them twice That's not ever \nTwice is every time we've tried That's ever \nWell we'll see them this year \nNo we won't It's pointless It's like waiting up to see Santa Claus \nI mean I feel like my whole life is gonna be spent standing on the beach with my eyes wide open and my hands clasped expectantly waiting for the fish to show up And the fish won't show up \nI thought you wanted to see it \nYou don't understand anything I'm saying \nNo of course not \nI did want to see it I always do I keep thinking that this is gonna be the time and it never is \nIt's just fish Nothing to get traumatized about \nAll right Look I've been trying to work this backwards but I cannot seem to figure out the exact moment that we took a turn for the worst \nYou said Hey the grunion are running tonight I said Great let's go I feel lucky \nOkay so I'm putting on my jacket putting out the animals getting the car out of the garage \nDo you remember the first time we came to see it It was about four years ago right after we got married \nI thought I was pregnant you had a bottle of champagne but no glasses You asked me to dance so we kicked off our shoes and you popped the cork \nAnd while we were dancing you said the softest most intimate things to me right into my ear so that I could feel them as much as hear them \nAnd I remember thinking this is it You know at last at last I am as happy as I am supposed to be \nWait a minute I've got it \nJust dancing barefoot in the sand drinking champagne out of the bottle \nIt was in the car right Driving past the Knickerbocker Liquor Locker you said let's get some champagne and I said time's a wasting or something like that right \nYeah of course I see it now You want this to be like that other time right That's it right \nI'd rather not remember some things I would rather not hope for some things \nOkay yeah sure I see it now Listen you wanna dance \nNo \nYou want me to go get some champagne \nNo \nTake off our shoes \nWell what You want me to breathe in your ear \nNo \nYou wanna get married again \nNo \nWhat What You want a divorce \nNo \nA vacation \nNo \nA new carpet A poodle Ice cream Back rub A suicide pact What What Carla what the hell do you want \nWell welcome to the human race Do you think this is what I had in mind when I proposed That four years down the road we'd be at the beach yelling at each other over fish \n'cause you know what you get Carla You know what you get This \nYes it is \nRight \nWell This isn't anything like I thought anything would be like \nI know me neither \nI'm doing the best I can \nI know that Augie Really I do \nI know that you meant this to be special and nice and the sand and the moon and all but I just couldn't help thinking about being somewhere else \nMaybe if you were with somebody else too \nI didn't say that \nNo I know But still I know I don't make you happy \nYou're the one who probably wishes you were with someone else Someone who you'd rather enjoy yourself and didn't take everything so hard \nI don't know It seemed like a pretty good spot to me I mean look at the view you have of the moon from here \nWell look what we have here \nAugie you brought refreshments \nIt's not champagne \nWell then we don't need glasses \nNo I think you might be right Maybe this is the spot after all \nAugie I'm sorry \nShh If we're very quiet the fish might come \nOr not \nOr not \nI wonder \nI don't care then \nHello Hello What Wrong number \nAh it send shivers up my spine \nBehave exquisitely \nWith the most perfect poise \nOh of course I shall probably do a court curtsy \nThings that ought to matter dreadfully don't matter at all when one's happy Do they \nWhat's so horrible is that one can't stay happy \nOh darling don't say that \nIt's true The whole business is a very poor joke \nMeaning that sacred and beautiful thing love \nYes meaning just that \nYou mustn't be serious my dear one That's just what they want \nWho's they \nAll those futile moralists that try to make life unbearable Laugh at them Be flippant Laugh at everything All their sacred shibboleths

the audio data has saved as .mat files, they can not use spark to analyze. \nAudio branch data:\nThe format of the audio data is the index.mat files(index from 0 to 7203). And each index.mat file corresponds to the features of the dialog audios from the actors. And the index.mat files correspond to the sentences with the same line index in text_output.txt. For each index.mat file, it contains a 2-D array with floating-point number. The audio data has been preprocessed by the dataset provider. And the contents of it are the features of the audio files extracted with Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients(MFCC) methods after the process of noise reduction and acoustic signal purification. Each matrix in the index.mat file has the same X dimension as 64 lines, which is split into the same size for the purpose of easy data-loading. The Y dimension of the matrix reveals different features of the sentences. And the length of features is proportional to the length of the dialog.\n","user":"xl422","dateUpdated":"2018-12-13T17:22:46-0500","config":{"colWidth":12,"enabled":true,"results":{},"editorSetting":{"language":"scala"},"editorMode":"ace/mode/scala"},"settings":{"params":{},"forms":{}},"apps":[],"jobName":"paragraph_1544502784221_1000111083","id":"20181210-233304_822768122","dateCreated":"2018-12-10T23:33:04-0500","status":"READY","progressUpdateIntervalMs":500,"$$hashKey":"object:471"}],"name":"Final","id":"2DXG8GKX7","angularObjects":{"2CK8A9MEG:xl422:":[],"2CKX6DGQZ:shared_process":[],"2C8A4SZ9T_livy2:shared_process":[],"2DPPK47F6:xl422:":[],"2DQHBFAF6:xl422:":[],"2CKEKWY8Z:xl422:":[],"2DRMGSB7A:xl422:":[],"2CKAY1A8Y:shared_process":[],"2CHS8UYQQ:xl422:":[]},"config":{"looknfeel":"default","personalizedMode":"false"},"info":{}}
